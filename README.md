# LeLiu_Projects

### This is a repository where I am sharing the process of image-processing projects during my visit in Beth Cimini's lab.

### Project 1: (maize stomata folder)
- Build the pipeline to automatically segment the guard and subsidiary cells, separately
- Optimize the analysis of images to capture the morphological features of the grass stomata
- Determine the morphological profiling analysis method
