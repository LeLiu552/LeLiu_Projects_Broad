### This is a repository where I am sharing the process of image-processing projects during my visit in Beth Cimini's lab.

### Project 1: Highthroughput phenotyping method of guard cells and subsidiary cells in maize (maize_stomata folder)
- Build the pipeline to automatically segment the guard and subsidiary cells, separately
- Optimize the analysis of images to capture the morphological features of the grass stomata
- Determine the morphological profiling analysis method
- Working on tensorflow and Keras workflow to train the raw object masks or images

### Project 2: 3D segment C.elegan with Paula

### Project3: Select a subset of features and run Harmony and/or Scanorama for the whole JUMP dataset (CRISPR, ORF, COMPOUND) with Suganya
